# Flames & Efficiency

When using Event Calculator, the amount of natural flames can be calculated by remaining hours and efficiency. In which the efficiency is a percentage, refering to how large the portion is in the whole flames that can actually be used.

In regular servers, if the sleeping time is 8 hours, then the most ideal efficiency will be 87.5%. This is because a player can get 48 flames in 24 hours, but can only save up to 10 flames; in the 8-hour sleeping, only 16 flames may be received, but in that 6 flames is wasted due to full storage. Which means that 6 flames are wasted in a day, while the other 42 flames can be used, giving the efficiency 42/48, or 87.5%. You can also calculate your own efficiency according to this method.

In CN, up to 25 flames can be saved, which means that any sleeping time under 12.5 hours will have a 100% efficiency since no flame is wasted.
